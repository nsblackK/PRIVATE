This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
population = mtcars
head(population)
dim(population)
summary(population)
# obtain an estimate of an average miles per gallon (mpg) of cars by taking a sample of size 8 using without replacemant
set.seed(15)
srswor=population[sampple(1:nrow(population),8),]
srswor
sample_mean=mean(srswor$mpg)
sample_mean
# check that wheather the above sample (using wor) provide an unbaised estimate of the population mean
pop_mean=mean(population$mpg)
pop_mean
N = length(population$mpg)
N
n=5
a11_possible_samples = choose(N,n) 
a11_possible_samples
set.seed(15)
sampledist<-replicate(a11_possible_samples,mean(sample(population$mpg,n)))
mean(sampledist)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
